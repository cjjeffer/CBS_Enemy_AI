# CBS_Enemy_AI

This is the main script responsible for the enemy behaviour exemplified in the video on my portfolio for the Cyberpunk game. It handles the shooting mechanics for the enemy, it tracks the current state of the active-ragdoll, and triggers the enemy's predefined sequence of animations that are played via a Playable Director component.
